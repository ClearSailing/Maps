# Places to launch you kayak (An  exerscise in google maps api)

This is a website that uses google maps api (3.0) to place markers on a map showing suitable places to launch a kayak.

The site itself of course is HTML and CSS. I used JavaScritpt and JQuery on the client side and used PHP to query the MYSQL data
